                <h2>Spirit of Rebellion</h2>
                <p>The first serious challenge to British rule in India came from the Indian Rebellion of 1857, which is seen as the beginning of serious opposition to British rule. In the garrison town of Meerut, a sepoy rebellion against the British East India Company began on May 10, 1857. Lakshmi bai had not yet rebelled against the British and had actually asked British political officer Captain Alexander Skene for permission to raise an armed guard unit for her protection, which she was given. Rapidly spreading was the torch of revolt in several north Indian cities. Princely estate owners and landlords who were dissatisfied began to rebel against the British soldiers.

                    The British had pledged to send men to Jhansi, but it took some time for them to arrive. Because some of Lakshmi bai’s advisors wanted to free Jhansi from British rule, the British forces were taken aback by the extent of security the city had put in place when they finally arrived in Jhansi in March 1858.
                    
                    The fort was equipped with heavy guns that could fire into the entire town. Sir Hugh Rose, the commander of the Central Indian Field Force, threatened to demolish the city if it refused to capitulate. At this time, Lakshmi bai proclaimed, they will fight for independence until the day of their death. Rose fought alongside the British troops to defend Jhansi on March 23, 1858, when they were under siege. She not only resisted the British soldiers with great strength, but she also requested and received help from Tantia Tope.</p>
